            <h2>Reference Standards for SAF Parameters</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon Intensity (CORSIA):</strong> Must achieve at least a 10% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, targeting values below 89 gCO₂e/MJ, with optimal values between 20–40 gCO₂e/MJ.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Density (ASTM D7566):</strong> SAF should meet the standard energy density of conventional jet fuels, approximately 42.8 MJ/kg, with acceptable SAF values between 40–44 MJ/kg.</li>
                <li><strong>Sulfur Content (ASTM D7566):</strong> SAF sulfur content should remain below 15 ppm to limit sulfur emissions and enhance environmental sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Flash Point (ASTM D7566):</strong> Minimum flash point requirement is 38°C to ensure fuel safety and compatibility with aviation handling.</li>
                <li><strong>NOx and CO Emissions:</strong> SAF should achieve a 15–25% reduction in NOx and CO emissions compared to conventional jet fuels.</li>

            <h2>What is EROI (Energy Return on Investment)?</h2>
            <p>EROI measures the efficiency of fuel production by comparing the energy output of the fuel to the energy input needed to produce it. For SAF, a higher EROI means the fuel provides more energy than it takes to produce, making it more sustainable and efficient.</p>
    
            <h3>Why EROI Matters:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High EROI (above 5):</strong> Indicates efficient production, where SAF provides much more energy than it consumes, supporting sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate EROI (3-5):</strong> Shows some efficiency, but production could be improved.</li>
                <li><strong>Low EROI (below 3):</strong> Suggests that producing SAF consumes almost as much energy as it generates, reducing its sustainability.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>How to Calculate:</h3>
            <p>To find EROI, divide Total Energy Output (MJ) by Total Energy Input (MJ) across all stages (feedstock production, transport, processing, and distribution).</p>
    
            
            <p><strong>EROI = </strong>
                <span class="fraction-inline">
                    <span class="numerator">Total Energy Output</span>
                    <span class="denominator">Total Energy Input</span>
                </span>
            </p>
            
    
            <p>A strong EROI score highlights SAF’s potential as a sustainable fuel, ensuring it produces energy efficiently while meeting aviation needs.</p>
